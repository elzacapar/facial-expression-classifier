# Facial Expression Classifier

A deep learning project that classifies human facial expressions into 7 emotion 
categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER-2013 dataset.

Built as part of a Data Science education assignment. The assignment was given in Swedish 
but the project is documented in English to make it accessible as a portfolio piece.

## Overview

The model classifies grayscale 48x48 face images into one of 7 emotions:
`angry`, `disgust`, `fear`, `happy`, `neutral`, `sad`, `surprise`

**Final model performance:** 52.8% test accuracy (random baseline: 14.3%)

## Demo

![App screenshot](screenshot.png)

The app supports both image upload and live webcam input.
Note that webcam predictions may be less reliable than uploaded images,
as the model was trained on curated 48x48 grayscale photos rather than 
real-world webcam conditions.

## Run the App

```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
python app.py
```

Opens at `http://127.0.0.1:7860`.

- **Upload mode:** upload any photo of a face to get an emotion prediction
- **Webcam mode:** switch to webcam for live predictions directly in the browser

## What the Notebook Covers

1. **Data exploration** — class distribution, sample images, data quality observations
2. **Data preparation** — normalization, train/validation split, pipeline setup
3. **Model building** — CNN architecture with Conv2D, BatchNorm, Dropout layers
4. **Training** — 3 iterations with documented reasoning, early stopping, training curves
5. **Evaluation** — accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, per-class analysis
6. **Predictions** — inference on unseen images with confidence scores
7. **Analysis** — overfitting diagnosis, limitation discussion, class imbalance
8. **Reflection** — lessons learned, what would be done differently

## Key Findings

- Class imbalance significantly affects performance — `disgust` (436 images) is never 
  predicted correctly while `happy` (7,215 images) achieves F1: 0.77
- Iteration 3 (BatchNorm + Dropout + Augmentation) reduced the train/val accuracy gap 
  from 18% to 6%, indicating better generalization
- Visually similar emotions (`fear`, `sad`, `neutral`) are frequently confused

## Dataset
